  globally for all connections (ssl_default_ciphers) and foreach connection
  (ssl_ciphers).
- allow to set DH parameter used for clients SSL connections with the new
  client_side_dh_param parameter.

2009-01-24 (0.8.x)
Visible changes:
- One logfile per nick for queries, instead of the messy privates.x.log
  Slight log format change (now the format of the log of queries is very
  similar to the on used for channels)
- "Window"-local blreset and blreset on talk. By default the blreset_on_talk
  now only clears the backlog of the query you talked to or the channel you
  talked to.  The /quote bip blreset command now can take a query name or a
  channel name as an argument. "/quote bip blreset" still resets the backlog of
  the whole network.
- /quote bip backlog x command where x is the number of hours will backlog x
  hours.
- autorejoin on kick by default. Can be disabled with the option
  autojoin_on_kick = false in a connection block.
- bip SSL on the client<->bip part now support Ephemeral Diffie Hellman key
  exchange.

- New commands (allow a user to add a new network without restarting bip for
  instance)
- Better user feedback when issuing /bip commands.
- Lots of new backlog options, some of which can now be set per user instead of
  globally.
- And a few fixes on top of that.

2008-02-07  Arnaud Cornet <nohar@t1r.net>
What's to expect in bip now:
- Support kill -HUP and /bip reload cleanly.
- Close/reopen files on sighup.
- Have some reply when running BIP commands.  ssl_check_mode, always_backlog,
  backlog, bl_msg_only, backlog_lines, backlog_no_timestamp, blreset_on_talk be
  settable at the connection block rather than the user block.
- Add backlog option to channels. Useful if you don't care about one particular
  channel.
- bip_use_notice: Add this option to receive bip message through notices.
- Make SSL "basic" certificate check more loose (more SSH-like).  In "basic"
  mode, normally un trusted certificates get to be trusted if they manually
  trusted by user. This provides an SSH like private key auth mechani Expired
  certificates were considered invalid in this mode which does not make much
  sense.
- blreset: add -q option to /bip blreset command if you don't want it to reply
  anything (for scripts).
- Support add_conn and del_conn bip commands for live connection addition and
  removal.
- Have a bold arrow to highligh your own word on private messages and multiple
  connected clients.

2007-12-09
- Bip has now two types of users "admins" and normal user. Some commands are
  reserved to admin. Add a admin = true; statement in your config (in user
  block) accordingly.

2007-10-29
- Certificate validation change. In "basic" mode, expired certificates are now
  accepted as long as they are in store (therefore trusted). This makes the
  basic mode be more SSH like. Some extreme security zealots might want to be
  warned.

2007-09-02
- as of now log parameters go in the user {} statment. This breaks
  every config and there is no backwrads compatibility as of now.
- Lots of internal changes, expect crashes.

2007-08-19 (0.6.1)
- Fixes half closed socket descriptor leak, as well as a potential crash on
  startup.
- Bip switches to git. You can clone the public repository with:
- git clone http://bip.t1r.net/bip.git

2007-02-27 (0.6.0)
- Includes more commands, more options, more fixes.
- UPDATE: Thanks to YS for the sexy logo! How rude of me to forget to give
  proper credits!
- Bip is developed by Arnaud Cornet and Loïc Gomez and is distributed under
  the GNU Public License Version 2 (see the AUTHORS file for a list of
  contributors).
